My first selection of bio-related POP music is...

## "Nomus et Phusis" by stereolab (2000)

This track is included in the album **"The First of the Microbe Hunters"**. The album title makes reference to the book called **"Microbe Hunters"** by Paul Henry de Kruif (microbiologist/author). "The First of the Microbe Hunters" is the first chapter of this book and dedicated to Dutch scientist **Anton van Leeuwenhoek**. Leeuwenhoek is known as "the Father of Microbiology".
